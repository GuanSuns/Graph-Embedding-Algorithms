# Dataset

### Due to file size limitation on Github, you might need to parse and generate some of the large dataset by yourself from the original raw dataset. The corresponding preprocessor/parser functions can be found under the [data_preprocessor directory](https://github.com/GuanSuns/Graph-Embedding-Algorithms/tree/master/data_preprocessor)
