## Sampling Strategy

- **Biased Walk**
    - **implementation**: https://github.com/GuanSuns/Graph-Embedding-Algorithms/blob/master/sampling/biased_walk.py
    - **citation**: Nguyen, Duong, and Fragkiskos D. Malliaros. "BiasedWalk: Biased Sampling for Representation Learning on Graphs." 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data). IEEE, 2018.
    - **note**: the implementation is based on the author's [open-source code](https://github.com/duong18/BiasedWalk/tree/master/source)

## Dataset
All the dataset in the data directory have been parsed into edgelist format, which are compatible with the library [GEM: Graph Embedding Methods](https://github.com/palash1992/GEM) and the [node2vec (python implementation)](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec).

### Due to file size limitation on Github, you might need to parse and generate some of the large dataset by yourself from the original raw dataset. The corresponding preprocessor/parser functions can be found under the [data_preprocessor directory](https://github.com/GuanSuns/Graph-Embedding-Algorithms/tree/master/data_preprocessor)
